## Diamond Price Prediction

> About the Data : The goal is to predict price of given diamond (Regression Analysis).

> There are 10 independent variables :

>> id : unique identifier of each diamond 
>> carat : Carat (ct.) refers to the unique unit of weight measurement used exclusively to weigh gemstones and diamonds. 
>> cut : Quality of Diamond Cut 
>> color : Color of Diamond 
>> clarity : Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone, graded by the visibility of these characteristics under 10-power magnification. 
>> depth : The depth of diamond is its height (in millimeters) measured from the culet (bottom tip) to the table (flat, top surface) table : A diamond's table is the facet which can be seen when the stone is viewed face up. 
>> x : Diamond X dimension 
>> y : Diamond Y dimension 
>> z : Diamond Z dimension 

> Target variable:

>>price: Price of the given Diamond.
